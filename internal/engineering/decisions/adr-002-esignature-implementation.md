# ADR-002: E-signature Implementation for Liability Waivers

## Status
Accepted

## Context

Training Daydreamers needed a legally compliant way to collect electronic signatures for liability waivers during the client intake process. Previously, waivers were sent via PDF and returned manually, creating friction in the onboarding process.

The key requirements were:
- Legal compliance with electronic signature laws
- Seamless integration with existing intake flow
- Secure storage and audit trail
- User-friendly experience

Alternatives considered:
1. Third-party e-signature service (DocuSign, Adobe Sign)
2. Manual PDF workflow (status quo)
3. Custom drawing-based signature capture
4. Typed name as legal signature

## Decision

Implement a client-side PDF generation and upload system with typed signature names as the primary signature method, backed by comprehensive audit trails.

**Technical Implementation:**
- Generate signed PDF on client-side using React-PDF
- Upload directly to Cloudinary with public access
- Include audit trail: timestamp, IP address, user agent
- Use typed signature name (e.g., "/s/ John Doe") for legal compliance
- Store PDF metadata in MongoDB with client record

## Consequences

**Positive:**
- Seamless user experience integrated with intake flow
- Legally compliant with proper audit trails
- No recurring costs for third-party services
- Full control over data and security
- Fast PDF generation and delivery

**Negative:**
- More complex implementation than third-party service
- Requires careful attention to legal compliance
- Audit trail complexity adds development overhead
