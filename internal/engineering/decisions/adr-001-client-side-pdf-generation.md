# ADR-001: Client-side PDF Generation for Liability Waivers

## Status
Accepted

## Context

Training Daydreamers needed to implement electronic signature collection for liability waivers during the client intake process. The existing manual PDF workflow created friction and delayed client onboarding.

**Requirements:**
- Legally compliant electronic signatures
- Seamless integration with existing intake flow
- Secure PDF storage and audit trails
- User-friendly signature process
- No recurring costs for third-party services

**Alternatives Considered:**
1. **Third-party e-signature services** (DocuSign, Adobe Sign) - High recurring costs, complex integration
2. **Server-side PDF generation** - Performance issues, limited scalability
3. **Drawing-based signatures** - Poor user experience on mobile
4. **Manual PDF workflow** - Status quo, inefficient

## Decision

Implement client-side PDF generation using React-PDF with typed signature names as the primary signature method, integrated with Cloudinary for secure storage.

**Technical Architecture:**
- Client-side PDF generation using `@react-pdf/renderer`
- Typed signature names ("/s/ John Doe") for legal compliance
- Cloudinary direct upload for PDF storage
- Comprehensive audit trail (timestamp, IP address, user agent)
- Modal-based signature interface with full waiver preview

## Consequences

**Positive:**
- ✅ Zero recurring costs for signature collection
- ✅ Seamless user experience integrated with intake flow
- ✅ Full legal compliance with audit trails
- ✅ Fast PDF generation and delivery
- ✅ Complete control over data security and privacy

**Negative:**
- ❌ More complex implementation than third-party services
- ❌ Requires careful attention to legal compliance details
- ❌ Client-side processing requires sufficient browser resources

## Implementation Details

### Core Components
- **WaiverPDF Component**: Generates PDF with signature and audit data
