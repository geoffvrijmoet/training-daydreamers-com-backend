      "description": "<p>What makes good dog play? All sorts of things! It's important to keep in mind that different dogs have different <em>play styles, </em>depending on personality, breed, and more. Some dogs like lots of body contact, other dogs prefer mostly chasing. Some dogs like to be extra mouthy and vocal, other dogs play gently. Watch your dog to learn what their preference is, and keep in mind that most often dogs with similar play styles will be best suited to one another: a dog who mostly prefers chase may be offended by a body slammer, for instance. </p><p></p><p>Beyond play styles we get to appropriate interactions: Good dog play involves <em>role switching, </em>meaning, we shouldn't always see one dog chasing the other. They should be taking turns. Good dog play involves <em>emotional regulation. </em>The dogs should be happily taking pauses in play, even if they're brief. Shaking off. Taking a sniff break. Good dog play involves <em>appropriate deferring, </em>meaning, if you have a large dog and a small dog playing together we like to see the larger dog shifting their play style to be more gentle, and offering the other dog to play the more \"dominant\" role. Good play should look <em>floppy, ineffective, and silly. </em>Spins, bouncy play bows, happy panting, etc.</p>"

Especially as the age into social maturity (around 3 years old) their preferences may change. We go through the same shift! Think of the average little kid, eager to play with everyone at the playground, versus the average adult who find a stranger's approach at a bus stop to be a social faux pas. Dog social preferences are as diverse as the dogs themselves.</p>",

They evolved right alongside us, and have picked up some really spectacular observational skills in the process (not to mention what information they're likely getting from the olfactory system). We can use their observational skills to our advantage by signaling to them what they appropriate response is. Talk to your dog, using the energy you'd like reflected back to you, and show them with your own emotions that they have nothing to worry about.</p><p></p><p>A perfect example of this is in the case of dogs who bark at sounds in your hallway: oftentimes its enough to simply say, \"thank you for telling me!\" and then walking away and encouraging your dog to follow your lead, signaling that they have finished with their duties.</p>"

Think about the times in your life when you've been stressed, and you've snapped at a loved one. It's not the loved ones fault, but your aggression comes out towards them because they are right there! Be cautious about putting your hand near your dog when they are experiencing high levels of stress, because redirections can happen.</p>"

We should, of course, always aim to stay <em>below threshold</em>, but it’s important to note that arousal/stress stays in the body for up to 3 days!! So if your dog goes over threshold you may want to take things easy for a few days, and prioritize relaxation work in the interim… things like nosework, massage, etc.</p>"

While we do want to make sure we’re meeting all of our dogs physical and mental exercise needs throughout the day, (and may benefit from upping that ratio when we need a calmer dog, like taking them for a longer walk before guests come over) if we don’t let our dogs get the proper amount of rest we may accidentally create the “overtired toddler effect.” Our dogs require 16-18 hours of sleep a day, and without that they can have a significant increase in stress. We need to find the balance of rest and activity for our dogs that helps them feel content. Maybe a better phrase is “a fulfilled dog is a good dog.”</p>"

Most nutrition focused vets recommend regularly rotating your dog’s food, both in protein source and even in brand. Think of it like this… sure you can survive off of pasta every day for your whole life, but would you thrive?? All animals require variety in their diet for optimal nutrition. Keep in mind that if your dog has eaten the same food for a long time you may need to do a slow transition to new foods.</p></li><li class=\"pl-1\"><p>Adding fresh food to a dog’s diet can also help with their gut health! This also has a significant impact on dog allergies. When you can adding some fruits and vegetables, kefir, or sardines can make a huge difference. Dogs can have <em>most </em>of the food that we can. The only real exceptions are chocolate (duh… xylitol specifically is very toxic to dogs, and is in some peanut butters and other processed foods, so keep an eye out for that), grapes, onions, and macadamia nuts.&nbsp;</p></li><li class=\"pl-1\"><p>Dog’s have zero nutritional requirement for carbs in their diet, yet 90% of kibble is PACKED with carbs to make it cheaper. It is my opinion (based in scientific research) that this is the reason for the obesity epidemic in the pet world.</p></li></ul><p></p><p><a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" class=\"text-blue-500 hover:underline\" href=\"https://www.instagram.com/doctorwolfe.dvm/\">Dr. Hillary Wolfe is a great resource on instagram!</a></p>"

In order to teach “no” the dog needs to make a mistake. In an ideal training world we are guiding our dogs (through cues and environmental management) to the right decisions in the first place. Always remember, most undesirable behaviors are only undesirable to the human. To the dog, they are perfectly natural! Additionally, when you punish a behavior you’re really just suppressing it… suppressed behaviors will always find a way out.</p>"

Panting could be stress, or they could be hot. That said there are some subtle signs of stress that we can pay attention to! Pay lots of attention to all dogs body language, not just your own. At the start try to stick to objective observations, without applying judgment (aka “his tail is low, his ears are back” vs “he looks stressed”). Some common signs of subtle stress are lip licking, yawning, shaking off (aka shaking off the stress, sort of akin to a big sigh in humans after a stressful experience), exposing the belly, and turning away.</p>"

That’s why it’s absolutely critical to understand your dog's body language so you can avoid miscommunications in the conversation of play! Different dogs have different play styles (usually influenced at least in part by their breed): you’ve got the body slammers, the chasers, the mouthy dogs, and more. Pay attention to the play your dog engages in the most often, and cater your play style to them. Make sure your dog is nice and relaxed with loose body language, and take lots of breaks to manage arousal levels (see “break” cue for dog to dog play). Breaks can also be very helpful to make sure everyone is still having a good time– basically a consent check during play. Have fun with your dog!!</p>"

Lure them into a down position, and immediately put down about 10 lower value treats. Feed treats with a high rate of reinforcement to keep them in the position. Then gradually slow down your rate of reinforcement as long as they remain on the mat, and reinforce for signs of relaxation in their body language: things like hip shifts, resting their head, sighing, taking in their environment calmly, etc. <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" class=\"text-blue-500 hover:underline\" href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1KBCtnqqjWpW3I3ocar_F_1nCjWLMV7Vj/view?usp=drive_link\">You can review this document for some extra tips.</a></p>"

      "description": "<p>While it is sometimes necessary to pick up our dogs, we should really aim to do this as little as possible. For most dogs it can add to their stress and lack of agency in their world. Additionally, when we do lift our dogs it is very important to give them a heads up with a lift cue. Say “1, 2, 3, lift!” and lift your dog. That way they at least see it coming and can emotionally prepare themselves for it.</p>"

      "description": "<p>At the start of every day take 50 treats and put them into a bowl (or several bowls dispersed throughout your home, for easier access). Every time you see your dog doing a behavior that you like (settling on their own, independent play, hanging out in their crate, sitting politely for a greeting) mark “yes” and follow with a treat! This is a super simple way to reinforce desired behaviors that our dogs are already doing every day. Remember, learning is happening all the time, whether you are in a training session or not.</p>"

It’s a great way to teach some impulse control, as well as building in safety practices to your play with your dog, so they don’t get too excited and bite the wrong thing. There are two methods to teaching drop-it using toys…The single toy method, in which we animate the toy and play collaboratively with your dog for a bit, and then make the toy go limp… the second your dog lets go of the toy we mark “yes!” and reanimate the toy! Simple. You can also use the two-toy method in which you present a second toy of equal value as an incentive for your dog to release the first toy. Once they release, again you mark “yes!” and toss the second toy… then go back and forth between the two in this fashion.</p>"

      "description": "<p>Dogs are natural scavengers so the instinct to find “food” (trash) on the streets is <em>high. </em>Prevention is always<em> </em>better than asking a dog to let go of something they already have in their mouth. It is <em>easier </em>and safer! On top of being aware of your environment on the human end of the leash, and avoiding high value trash that you know your dog will go for, we can teach leave-it. In “leave it” we are telling your dog to disengage from the thing that’s peaking their interest. Note: there is a difference between <em>wait</em> and <em>leave-it</em>: In <em>wait</em> you are telling your dog “hold on a second and then you can have this thing,” whereas in <em>leave-it </em>you are telling your dog they will <em>never </em>get to have the thing. Both are valuable skills, but they are different!</p>"

      "description": "<p>Loose leash walking is a combination of engagement and giving appropriate freedom to explore to your dog. Remember, you pick the path, and your dog picks the stops along the way. It’s important for your dog to smell out in the world! This alone helps immensely with loose leash walking. Additionally, we want your dog checking in with you consistently! Reward every time your dog checks in with you, or lands within the “magic zone” (aka 2-3 radius from you). If they start pulling towards something, <em>stop</em>, call them back to you, and then approach together on a loose leash. Changing directions frequently and adjusting your pace can also help immensely in loose-leash walking. Keep in mind that most dogs naturally walk at a faster pace than we do, and when possible it can be helpful to increase our own pace to set them up for more success walking on a loose leash.</p>"

      "description": "<p>Potty training is all about building our dog’s <em>preferences</em> for potty zones. It is inherently reinforcing to go to the bathroom (it feels good to release!). This means that every time your dog successfully eliminates on a surface they are being reinforced for using that location as a potty spot. Because of this, it is critical that you set your dog up to have lots of success eliminating in “legal” places (whether outside, or on pee pads if you’re opting to use pee pads), and very little success eliminating in “illegal” places (like your rug, on your couch, etc). During potty training your dog must be in one of three circumstances at all times: confined in a place where they are unlikely to eliminate (like a crate, or a playpen), free roaming under your very close supervision, or in a legal potty zone. When your dog eliminates in the correct spot there should be a huge celebration, along with a special, high value, potty training treat. Note: make sure you’re using an enzyme based cleaner to clean up those messes! That’s the only way to ensure the smell is eliminated, even against your dog’s all powerful nose.</p>"

      "title": "Treat & Retreat",
      "description": "<p>Often our dogs are okay with people being close to them when there is food, but as soon as the food is gone they are back to scared or upset. Additionally, most dogs don’t understand that they can <em>move away</em> instead of just barking, or even worse, biting. This is why we teach dogs to <em>retreat</em> after tossing treats. Have your dog approach your “stranger” (a trainer, a trusted friend or neighbor, etc) only to the distance they are comfortable (balanced on all four paws, relaxed body language). Your stranger will then toss a treat as close to the dog as they can, followed by a treat tossed <em>away </em>from the dog, so the dog learns to retreat. Note: you can apply the same principle with dogs who are fearful of objects… put a treat as close to the object as your dog is comfortable with, and then toss a treat <em>away </em>from the object so they can self regulate.&nbsp;</p><p><br><strong>Human Treat &amp; Retreat</strong>: Approach a safe distance (assessed by your dog’s body language), toss a treat, and then walk away. The treats should be <em>non contingent</em>, meaning we aren’t requiring the dog to come close to something that scares them in order to access food. Otherwise your dog may feel a lot of conflict, which can escalate. You can ask friends and neighbors to do this process regularly to help foster a sense of safety around strangers. This training exercise is often used for resource guarding as well, because it is, again, <em>non contingent. </em>It teaches your dog that your approach is not a <em>threat </em>to their resource.</p>"

When they are on the tether you are <em>not </em>to look at them, or engage with them in any way. That is their “me-time.” Start at very short durations, like 2-5 minutes, and work your way up to longer durations. When your dog is done with tether meditation simply unclip them and walk away.
